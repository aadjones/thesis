This work would not be possible without the help and support of many of my colleagues, friends, and family.

First, I would like to express the deepest gratitude to my committee chair, Professor Ted Kim. I was immediately inspired by your pattern formation class and somehow managed to maneuver into an entire area of study (computer graphics) that I had virtually no prior background in! You were always very patient with me nonetheless and managed to guide me through the various minefields of C++ programming and other CG basics, all while tactfully not shooting down some of my more exotic ideas (quantum computer graphics, anyone?) There were many moments of difficulty and frustration, but you helped me persevere in the end.

I am very grateful to Professor JoAnn Kuchera-Morin for serving on my committee. Your computer music class on Gamma helped inspire me to pursue the degree in Media Arts and Technology in the first place! We had many interesting and valuable discussions on the compositional process. 

My sincere appreciation goes to Professor Clarence Barlow for serving on my committee. Every single one of your music courses was a revelation to me, and I certainly would not be in the Media Arts and Technology department without your influence. 

My research in data compression owes a great debt to my collaborator Professor Pradeep Sen, who provided many insightful comments and ideas.

My thanks to my friends nearby and far away, who provided much-needed diversion as well support in difficult times. 

Finally, to my mom, thank you for supporting and believing in me, even during the dark times. To my partner Lauren, thank you for being there for me every step of the way. And finally, to my cat, Professor Charles, who has been waiting long enough for the last member of the family to get their PhD!
