\section{Thesis Statement and Main Results}
The thesis statement is as follows:

\begin{addmargin}[1em]{2em}
{\em The method of subspaces in computational fluid dynamics for computer graphics can be leveraged to systematically produce artistic audiovisual pieces.}
\end{addmargin}
In particular, I demonstrate three main results:

\begin{itemize}
	\item I propose a versatile system of sonification of fluid subspaces.
	\item I describe a data compression algorithm for fluid subspaces to help ease high computational costs.
	\item I demonstrate the sonification system with an audiovisual {\'e}tude.
\end{itemize}
