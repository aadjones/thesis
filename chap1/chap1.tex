\chapter{Introduction}

The abstract form of fluids in the natural world has inspired artists and scientists for centuries. 
For instance, in through careful experimentation, Leonardo da Vinci (1452--1519), besides studying water from an artistic perspective, also discovered the law of conservation of mass for incompressible one-dimensional flows \cite{gad1998fluid}. A myriad of impressionistic works such as Hokusai's {\em The Great Wave off Kanagawa} (1829--1833), van Gogh's {\em The Starry Night} (1889), Monet's {\em Water Lilies} (1897--1926), and many others draw inspiration from the variety of moods that water and air express, capturing destruction, abstraction, and serenity, all with their still images. In the sonic arts, composers such as Debussy and Ravel explored the unfolding undulations of fluids over time in a way that visual artists could not, composing impressionistic pieces such as {\em Une barque}, {\em La Mer}, {\em Reflets dans l'eau}, {\em Le vent dans la plaine}, and {\em Jeux d'eau}. Through their harmonic and rhythmic language, these pieces abstractly depict the variety of moods that fluids can express, from turbulent spray to calm stillness. However, a formal interplay between a particular time-evolving process of fluid dynamics and time-evolving sound is not present. Such formal approaches to generating art were not explored until the twentieth century.

The Greek composer and architect, Iannis Xenakis (1922--2001), was an early pioneer of the use of mathematical processes in music composition. Two of his compositions, {\em Pithoprakta} (1955--56) and {\em N'Shima} (1975) relied on mathematical processes derived from the statistical mechanics of gases on a molecular level. His magnum opus, {\em Formalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in Music} \cite{xenakis1992formalized}, expounds his aesthetic philosophy as well as his techniques for composing music stochastically through mathematical processes. 

In the visual arts, more powerful computing and research into computer graphics eventually led to the area of physics-based fluid animation. Early research in the field of computational fluid dynamics and mechanical engineering in the 1960s became translated into the domain of computer graphics starting in the 1990s. Work by O'Brien, Fedkiw, Bridson, Stam, Treuille, and others paved the way for many different types of fluid animation, ranging from real-time, simplistic effects suitable for computer games, to photorealistic renders for films. A large body of work has been dedicated to improving the efficiency of these physics-based simulations. 

The experiment of Ernst Chladni (1756--1827), involving the patterns of sand accumulating on the surface of vibrating metal plates, was an early audiovisual link between visual shape and sonic frequency. Using a violin bow to vibrationally excite a metal plate covered with sand, Chladni observed a variety of intriguing nodal patterns, depending on the shape of the plate as well as the frequency of the vibration. The Swiss scientist Hans Jenny (1904--1972) pioneered the general study of this principle of visual patterns associated with sonic vibrations, which he named ``Cymatics.'' 


\section{Thesis Statement and Main Results}
The thesis statement is as follows:

\begin{addmargin}[1em]{2em}
{\em The method of subspaces in computational fluid dynamics for computer graphics can be leveraged to systematically produce artistic audiovisual pieces.}
\end{addmargin}
In particular, I demonstrate three main results:

\begin{itemize}
	\item I propose a versatile system of sonification of fluid subspaces.
	\item I describe a data compression algorithm for fluid subspaces to help ease high computational costs.
	\item I demonstrate the sonification system with several audiovisual {\'e}tudes.
\end{itemize}
